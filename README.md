## Hi there! 

Here on my GitHub page you can find various smaller experiments and hobby projects. I like to tinker with programming/markup languages, systems programming, human-computer interaction and web technologies (especially WASM related). Mostly writing Rust and Haskell for fun, but also some C++, TypeScript and Python when needed.

Professionally, I have a M.Sc. in Computer Science (focusing on PLT and Logic) and I'm currently working with R&D at Opera and GameMaker.
