## Hi there! 

Here on my GitHub page you can find various smaller experiments and hobby projects. I like to tinker with programming/markup languages, systems programming, human-computer interaction and web technologies (especially WASM related). Mostly writing Rust and Haskell for fun, but also some C++, JavaScript and Python when needed.

Currently, Iâ€™m pursuing a M.Sc. in Computer Science (Algorithms, Languages and Logic) at Chalmers University of Technology in Gothenburg, Sweden.
